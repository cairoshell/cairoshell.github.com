<h3 id="cairodescription">What is Cairo?</h3>

<p>Cairo is a desktop environment for Windows. Currently in the alpha stages, our goal is to develop a desktop experience that increases productivity and advances current technology standards. With a focus on stability, performance, and productivity, Cairo aims to deliver an interface that exceeds expectations and delivers superior ease of use.</p>

<h3 id="opensource">What are the guidelines for contributing to Cairo?</h3>
<p>You can log into GitHub and make changes to our git repository. Naturally, we ask that you be professional and not damage the code. Go nuts with your skills to help us make Cairo the best it can be!
<br /><br />
There are several notes we must make regarding edits:
<br />
    * The Cairo team has locally branched code. We will only release these branches.<br />
    * Code committed to our git repository should not change or break any of Cairo’s user interface guidelines. We have worked hard in order to carefully craft our user interface.<br />
    * Committed code should be tested to make sure it doesn’t cause instability.<br />
    * Changes that are malicious or extraneous will not be tolerated.<br />
    * Code which meets our guidelines and quality expectations will be merged into our local, official code branches.<br />
<br />
We look forward to seeing what the community can come up with and thank you all for your continued support.
</p>
<h3 id="shelldescription">What is a Windows shell?</h3>

<p>Cairo is a Windows shell. A shell is an environment for your computer that allows you to browse files, launch applications, and interact with your computer. The current Windows shell is the 'Start' menu, the taskbar, and if you have Windows Vista, the translucent window borders.</p>


<h3 id="operatingsystems">What operating system(s) are supported?</h3>

<p>Cairo is currently only being tested against Windows 10, however it may run under Windows Vista, 7, 8, and 8.1.</p>

<h3 id="installation">How do I install Cairo?</h3>


<p>Cairo will install with an executable file (.exe) when released to the public. Once installed, Cairo will guide the user through a quick and easy configuration process and be ready to use in less than fifteen minutes.</p>

<h3 id="sysrequirements">What are the system requirements?</h3>


<p>Cairo is being built with performance and stability in mind. The recommended system requirements have not yet been determined. Nevertheless, if you can run Windows XP or Windows Vista well, Cairo will most likely run smoothly.</p>
<h3 id="benefits">What are the benefits of Cairo?</h1>


<p>Cairo offers many enhancements over the typical Windows environment. Many of these may be found on our <a href="index.html">homepage</a>. They include desktop file browsing, accessibility, and application enhancements.</p>


<h3 id="concerns">Will Cairo hurt my computer or replace important system files?</h3>

<p>Cairo will not replace any system files or cause any damage to your hardware or files. Cairo will be removable through the Control Panel under Add/Remove Programs.</p>

<h3 id="languagesupport">What languages will be supported?</h3>
<p>Cairo will support Unicode or similar methods to allow for language customization. The primary language will be English, with support for Spanish, German, Russian, Chinese/Japanese/Korean and others coming later. Language support will be dependent upon community input and involvement.</p>


<h3 id="availability">When will Cairo be out of the alpha and beta stages?</h3>

<p>The first Cairo alpha was released January 15, 2009 to private testers. While Cairo is still in its infancy, we have made great progress on features and stability. At this time, we have no date set for our 1.0 release.</p>
